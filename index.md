## About Me
---
I am a 2nd year M.Tech student in Computational and Data Science Department ([CDS](http://cds.iisc.ac.in)) at [IISc](https://iisc.ac.in), Bengaluru. I am part of the Video Analytics Lab ([VAL](http://val.serc.iisc.ernet.in/valweb/index.html)) led by [Prof. R. Venkatesh Babu](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/)

For my M.Tech thesis, I am working on Adversarial Robustness of Deep Neural Networks. ([Hands-on tutorial](https://adversarial-ml-tutorial.org/))

## Projects 
#### DS 200 - Research Methods:
  Module 4: Literature Review and Software Tooling : [DS200](https://github.com/shivangikhare5/ds200)
   * Data Analysis and visualisation using data from [data.gov.in](data.gov.in/)
   * Literature Review related to research thesis.

#### SSIM based adversarial training:
   * Proposed a novel SSIM based adversarial training to achieve adversarial robustness for classification models in alignment to human perception.
   * Achieved better performance than standard PGD adversarial training against all White-Box attacks.

#### Graph Visualization using GraphTSNE:
   * Visualized graph-structured data using a variant of t-SNE and Graph Neural Network.
   * Achieved highest 1-NN accuracy and minimum total feature distance between nodes in lower dimension embedding.

## Experience 
#### Practical Trainee:
   * Development of an FPGA based high performance framework for Encryption Accelerators and RSA Integer Multiplier.
   * Achieved better performance than all generic Intel processors at [BARC](http://barc.gov.in/)

#### Research Intern (IASc-SRFP):
   * Implemented different No-reference and Full-reference Image Quality Assessment Algorithms which scores quality of a given image at [IIT H](https://iith.ac.in/)
   * Particular emphasis on SSIM and NIQE.
